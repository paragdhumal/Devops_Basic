What is Devops?
DevOps is a combination of practices, tools, and cultural philosophies that help organizations deliver applications and services faster.
It's a combination of "development" (Dev) and "operations" (Ops).

Tools Used in DevOps
1. Git - Version Control Tool
2. GitHub/Gitlab/BitBucket - Repository Tools
3. Jenkins - CICD Tools
4. Terraform - Infrastructure as a Code Tool
5. Maven - Build Tool
6. Sonarqube - Testing tool
7. Docker/Kubernetes - Containerization tools
8. Prometheus/Grafana - Monitoring Tools
9. Ansible/Chef/Puppet - Configuration management tools

=>So, basically these tools make Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) easy.
=>The developers develop the code, then the code is handled by DevOps Engineer.
=>Who then configures a pipeline in Jenkins to automatically test, build and deploy the code to the production environment.
=>Initially there was a methodology called Waterfall, in which the process was linear and sequential. It was difficult to 
do changes in code once the code was build or tested or deployed.
=>This methodology was replaced by Agile methodology, in which there was continuous improvement and collaboration across functions.
=>This methodology was later replaced by DevOps methodlogy. Devops is more of a collaboration between Developers and Operations team.
The SDLC is automated in Devops. The pipelines will automatically run when code is pushed in Github.
